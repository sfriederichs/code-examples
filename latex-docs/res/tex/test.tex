\chapter{Section the second}\label{section-the-second}}

This should be my second section. It \emph{really} ought to come after
the first section, all things considered. Reasons for this:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It's section 2 and 2 comes after 1
\item
  I'm going to pass the .tex file generated by Pandoc back to it as the
  second argument in the command line
\item
  Why do I need three bullets?
\end{itemize}
