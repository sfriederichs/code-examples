# Section the second #

This should be my second section. It *really* ought to come after the first section, all things considered. Reasons for this:

* It's section 2 and 2 comes after 1
* I'm going to pass the .tex file generated by Pandoc back to it as the second argument in the command line
* Why do I need three bullets?
